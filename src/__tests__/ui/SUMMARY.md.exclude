## Test Commands

```bash
# Run all UI tests
npm run test:ui

# Run UI tests in watch mode
npm run test:ui:watch

## Test IDs Added to Components

The following test IDs were added to existing components to facilitate testing:

1. **LoginScreen.tsx**
   - `login-email-input`
   - `login-password-input`
   - `login-button`
   - `register-button`
   - `guest-mode-button`

## Mocking Strategy

- Redux state mocked with `jest.mock('react-redux')`
- API calls mocked with `jest.mock()` for service modules
- Navigation mocked with `@react-navigation/native` mocks
- Native modules mocked through Jest setup
- Third-party libraries mocked as needed

## Future Improvements
